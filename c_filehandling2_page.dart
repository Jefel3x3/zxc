      Writing to a File in C:

      To write to a file in C programming, you can use the fprintf() function. The fprintf() function is used 
      to write formatted output to a file.

      Syntax:
      fprintf(filePointer, "format string", arguments);

      Example:
      FILE *fptr;
      fptr = fopen("file.txt", "w");
      fprintf(fptr, "Hello, World!");

      In this example, fprintf() writes the string "Hello, World!" to the file "file.txt" in write mode ("w"). 
      If the file does not exist, it creates a new file. If the file exists, it truncates the file to zero 
      length before writing.

      Closing a File:

      After writing to a file, it is important to close the file using the fclose() function to free up the 
      resources associated with the file.

      Syntax:
      fclose(filePointer);

      Example:
      fclose(fptr);

      This closes the file "file.txt" that was opened for writing.
