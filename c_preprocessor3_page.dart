      In C programming, conditional compilation allows certain parts of the code to be compiled or ignored 
      based on specific conditions. This is done using preprocessor directives such as #ifdef, #ifndef, 
      and #endif.

      #ifdef Directive:
      #ifdef identifier
        // Code to include if identifier is defined
      #endif

      Example:
      #define DEBUG
      #ifdef DEBUG
        printf("Debugging is enabled\n");
      #endif

      In this example, the printf statement will be included in the code if the DEBUG identifier is defined.

      #ifndef Directive:
      #ifndef identifier
        // Code to include if identifier is not defined
      #endif

      Example:
      #ifndef RELEASE
        printf("This is not a release build\n");
      #endif

      In this example, the printf statement will be included in the code if the RELEASE identifier is not defined.

      #endif Directive:
      The #endif directive is used to end a conditional compilation block started by #ifdef or #ifndef.

      Conditional compilation is useful for including or excluding certain parts of the code based on build 
      configurations, enabling or disabling debugging statements, and more.
