      C Language Introduction:

        C is a procedural programming language initially developed by Dennis Ritchie in the year 1972 
        at Bell Laboratories of AT&T Labs. It was mainly developed as a system programming language to 
        write the UNIX operating system.

      The main features of the C language include:

        • General Purpose and Portable
        • Low-level Memory Access
        • Fast Speed
        • Fast Speed

      These features make the C language suitable for system programming like an operating system or 
      compiler development.

      Why Should We Learn C?

        Many later languages have borrowed syntax/features directly or indirectly from the C language. Like 
        syntax of Java, PHP, JavaScript, and many other languages are mainly based on the C language. C++ is 
        nearly a superset of C language (Only a few programs may compile in C, but not in C++).

        So,  if a person learns C programming first, it will help him to learn any modern programming 
        language 
        as well. As learning C help to understand a lot of the underlying architecture of the operating 
        system. 
        Like pointers, working with memory locations, etc.

      Difference Between C and C++:

        C++ was created to add the OOPs concept into C language so they both have very similar syntax but 
        both are 
        a bit different from each other. Following are some main differences between C and C++ Programming 
        language.

          • C++ supports OOPs paradigm while C only have procedural concept of programming.
          • C++ have exception handling capablities. In C, we have to resolve manually.
          • There are no references in C.

      Components of a C Program:

        1. Header Files Inclusion – Line 1 [#include <stdio.h>]

          The first and foremost component is the inclusion of the Header files in a C program. A header file is 
          a file with 
          extension .h which contains C function declarations and macro definitions to be shared between several 
          source files. 
          All lines that start with # are processed by a preprocessor which is a program invoked by the compiler. 
          In the above 
          example, the preprocessor copies the preprocessed code of stdio.h to our file. The .h files are called 
          header files in C.

          Some of the C Header files:

            • stddef.h – Defines several useful types and macros.
            • stdint.h – Defines exact width integer types.
            • stdio.h – Defines core input and output functions
            • stdlib.h – Defines numeric conversion functions, pseudo-random number generator, and memory allocation
            • string.h – Defines string handling functions
            • math.h – Defines common mathematical functions.

        2. Main Method Declaration – Line 2 [int main()]

          The next part of a C program is to declare the main() function. It is the entry point of a C program and the 
          execution 
          typically begins with the first line of the main(). The empty brackets indicate that the main doesn’t take 
          any parameter 
          (See this for more details). The int that was written before the main indicates the return type of main(). 
          The value returned 
          by the main indicates the status of program termination. See this post for more details on the return type.

        3. Body of Main Method – Line 3 to Line 6 [enclosed in {}]

          The body of a function in the C program refers to statements that are a part of that function. It can be 
          anything like 
          manipulations, searching, sorting, printing, etc. A pair of curly brackets define the body of a function. 
          All functions must 
          start and end with curly brackets.

        4. Statement – Line 4 [printf(“Hello World”);]

          Statements are the instructions given to the compiler. In C, a statement is always terminated by a semicolon (;). 
          In this particular 
          case, we use printf() function to instruct the compiler to display “Hello World” text on the screen.

        5. Return Statement – Line 5 [return 0;]

          The last part of any C function is the return statement. The return statement refers to the return values from 
          a function. This return 
          statement and return value depend upon the return type of the function. The return statement in our program 
          returns the value from main(). 
          The returned value may be used by an operating system to know the termination status of your program. The 
          value 0 typically means successful termination.

      Application of C:

        • Operating systems: C is widely used for developing operating systems such as Unix, Linux, and Windows.
        • Embedded systems: C is a popular language for developing embedded systems such as microcontrollers, 
          microprocessors, 
          and other electronic devices.
        • System software: C is used for developing system software such as device drivers, compilers, and assemblers.
        • Networking: C is widely used for developing networking applications such as web servers, network protocols, 
          and network drivers.
        • Database systems: C is used for developing database systems such as Oracle, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.
        • Gaming: C is often used for developing computer games due to its ability to handle low-level hardware interactions.
        • Artificial Intelligence: C is used for developing artificial intelligence and machine learning applications such as 
          neural networks and deep learning algorithms.
        • Scientific applications: C is used for developing scientific applications such as simulation software and numerical 
          analysis tools.
        • Financial applications: C is used for developing financial applications such as stock market analysis and trading 
          systems.
