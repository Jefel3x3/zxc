      Logical operators in C are used to perform logical operations on two or more expressions. They return either true (1) 
      or false (0) based on the logical operation.

      • Logical AND (&&): Returns true if both operands are true.
      Example: if (a && b) { /* do something */ }

      • Logical OR (||): Returns true if at least one of the operands is true.
      Example: if (a || b) { /* do something */ }

      • Logical NOT (!): Returns true if the operand is false and vice versa.
      Example: if (!a) { /* do something */ }

      Logical operators are often used in decision-making structures such as if statements and loops to combine multiple 
      conditions and control the flow of a program based on those conditions.
