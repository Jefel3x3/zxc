      In C, you can use pointers to functions to store the address of a function and call that function indirectly through 
      the pointer. This allows you to create more flexible and dynamic code.

      Declaration Syntax:
      The syntax for declaring a pointer to a function is similar to declaring a normal function, but with an asterisk (*) 
      before the function name, indicating that it is a pointer.

      Example:
      int (*func_ptr)(int, int);

      This declares func_ptr as a pointer to a function that takes two int arguments and returns an int.

      Assigning Function Address:
      To assign a function's address to a function pointer, you simply use the function name without parentheses.

      Example:
      func_ptr = &add;

      Here, add is a function that takes two int arguments and returns an int. The & operator is optional when assigning a 
      function's address to a pointer.

      Calling a Function through a Pointer:
      To call a function through a function pointer, you use the dereference operator (*) followed by the function pointer 
      name and arguments in parentheses.

      Example:
      result = (*func_ptr)(10, 20);

      This calls the function pointed to by func_ptr with arguments 10 and 20, and assigns the result to a variable named 
      result.

      Using function pointers can be especially useful in situations where you want to pass a function as an argument to another 
      function, or when you want to implement callbacks and event handling mechanisms.
