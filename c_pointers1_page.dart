      Pointers in C are variables that store memory addresses. They are used to manage memory allocation and manipulation in 
      C programming.

      Declaring Pointers:
      To declare a pointer variable in C, you use the asterisk (*) symbol before the variable name. For example, to declare a 
      pointer to an integer variable, you would write:

      int *ptr;

      This declares a pointer variable named ptr that can store the memory address of an integer variable.

      Initializing Pointers:
      Pointers can be initialized with the memory address of another variable using the address-of operator (&). For example, to 
      initialize ptr with the address of an integer variable num, you would write:

      int num = 10;
      int *ptr = &num;

      Accessing Value at Pointer:
      You can access the value stored at a memory address pointed to by a pointer using the dereference operator (*). For example, 
      to access the value stored at the memory address stored in ptr, you would write:

      int value = *ptr;

      This assigns the value 10 (the value stored at the memory address pointed to by ptr) to the variable value.

      Pointers are powerful tools in C programming that allow you to manipulate memory directly. However, they require careful 
      management to avoid memory leaks and undefined behavior.
